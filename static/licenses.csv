"agent-base@6.0.2","Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;","","agent-base ========== ### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.  #### Some subclasses:  Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`. Send a pull request to list yours!   * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints  * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints  * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS  * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install agent-base ```   Example -------  Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):  ```js var net = require('net'); var tls = require('tls'); var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var agent = require('agent-base');  var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);  // This is the important part! parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {   var socket;   // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module   if (opts.secureEndpoint) {     socket = tls.connect(opts);   } else {     socket = net.connect(opts);   }   return socket; });  // Everything else works just like normal... http.get(parsed, function (res) {   console.log(''response' event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:  ```js agent(async function (req, opts) {   await sleep(1000);   // etc… }); ```  Return another `http.Agent` instance to 'pass through' the responsibility for that HTTP request to that agent:  ```js agent(function (req, opts) {   return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent; }); ```   API ---  ## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]  Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback` for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.  The `options` object accepts the following properties:    * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).  The callback function should have the following signature:  ### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined  The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will continue to proceed.  If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the `secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

"assert-plus@1.0.0","","","# assert-plus  This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks like this:  ```javascript     var assert = require('assert-plus');      function fooAccount(options, callback) {         assert.object(options, 'options');         assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');         assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');         assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');         assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');         assert.func(callback, 'callback');          // Do stuff         callback(null, {});     } ```  # API  All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError` will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:      AssertionError: foo (string) is required     at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)     at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)     at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)     at Object..js (module.js:464:10)     at Module.load (module.js:353:31)     at Function._load (module.js:311:12)     at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)  from:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.string(foo, 'foo');     } ```  There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:  ```javascript     function test(foo) {         assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');     } ```  You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):  ```javascript     assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo'); ```  Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from the `assert` module avoids this behavior.  The complete list of APIs is:  * assert.array * assert.bool * assert.buffer * assert.func * assert.number * assert.finite * assert.object * assert.string * assert.stream * assert.date * assert.regexp * assert.uuid * assert.arrayOfArray * assert.arrayOfBool * assert.arrayOfBuffer * assert.arrayOfFunc * assert.arrayOfNumber * assert.arrayOfFinite * assert.arrayOfObject * assert.arrayOfString * assert.arrayOfStream * assert.arrayOfDate * assert.arrayOfRegexp * assert.arrayOfUuid * assert.optionalArray * assert.optionalBool * assert.optionalBuffer * assert.optionalFunc * assert.optionalNumber * assert.optionalFinite * assert.optionalObject * assert.optionalString * assert.optionalStream * assert.optionalDate * assert.optionalRegexp * assert.optionalUuid * assert.optionalArrayOfArray * assert.optionalArrayOfBool * assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer * assert.optionalArrayOfFunc * assert.optionalArrayOfNumber * assert.optionalArrayOfFinite * assert.optionalArrayOfObject * assert.optionalArrayOfString * assert.optionalArrayOfStream * assert.optionalArrayOfDate * assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp * assert.optionalArrayOfUuid * assert.AssertionError * assert.fail * assert.ok * assert.equal * assert.notEqual * assert.deepEqual * assert.notDeepEqual * assert.strictEqual * assert.notStrictEqual * assert.throws * assert.doesNotThrow * assert.ifError  # Installation      npm install assert-plus  ## License  The MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"cli-table@0.3.5","Copyright (c) 2010 LearnBoost &lt;dev@learnboost.com&gt;","","CLI Table [![NPM Version](http://badge.fury.io/js/cli-table.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/cli-table) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Automattic/cli-table.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/Automattic/cli-table) =========  This utility allows you to render unicode-aided tables on the command line from your node.js scripts.  ![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/sYq4T.png)  ## Features  - Customizable characters that constitute the table. - Color/background styling in the header through   [colors.js](http://github.com/marak/colors.js) - Column width customization - Text truncation based on predefined widths - Text alignment (left, right, center) - Padding (left, right) - Easy-to-use API  ## Installation  ```bash     npm install cli-table ```  ## How to use  ### Horizontal Tables ```javascript var Table = require('cli-table');  // instantiate var table = new Table({     head: ['TH 1 label', 'TH 2 label']   , colWidths: [100, 200] });  // table is an Array, so you can `push`, `unshift`, `splice` and friends table.push(     ['First value', 'Second value']   , ['First value', 'Second value'] );  console.log(table.toString()); ```  ### Vertical Tables ```javascript var Table = require('cli-table'); var table = new Table();  table.push(     { 'Some key': 'Some value' }   , { 'Another key': 'Another value' } );  console.log(table.toString()); ``` ### Cross Tables Cross tables are very similar to vertical tables, with two key differences:  1. They require a `head` setting when instantiated that has an empty string as the first header 2. The individual rows take the general form of { 'Header': ['Row', 'Values'] }  ```javascript var Table = require('cli-table'); var table = new Table({ head: ['', 'Top Header 1', 'Top Header 2'] });  table.push(     { 'Left Header 1': ['Value Row 1 Col 1', 'Value Row 1 Col 2'] }   , { 'Left Header 2': ['Value Row 2 Col 1', 'Value Row 2 Col 2'] } );  console.log(table.toString()); ```  ### Custom styles The ```chars``` property controls how the table is drawn: ```javascript var table = new Table({   chars: { 'top': '═' , 'top-mid': '╤' , 'top-left': '╔' , 'top-right': '╗'          , 'bottom': '═' , 'bottom-mid': '╧' , 'bottom-left': '╚' , 'bottom-right': '╝'          , 'left': '║' , 'left-mid': '╟' , 'mid': '─' , 'mid-mid': '┼'          , 'right': '║' , 'right-mid': '╢' , 'middle': '│' } });  table.push(     ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']   , ['frob', 'bar', 'quuz'] );  console.log(table.toString()); // Outputs: // //╔══════╤═════╤══════╗ //║ foo  │ bar │ baz  ║ //╟──────┼─────┼──────╢ //║ frob │ bar │ quuz ║ //╚══════╧═════╧══════╝ ```  Empty decoration lines will be skipped, to avoid vertical separator rows just set the 'mid', 'left-mid', 'mid-mid', 'right-mid' to the empty string: ```javascript var table = new Table({ chars: {'mid': '', 'left-mid': '', 'mid-mid': '', 'right-mid': ''} }); table.push(     ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']   , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz'] );  console.log(table.toString()); // Outputs: (note the lack of the horizontal line between rows) //┌────────────┬─────┬──────┐ //│ foo        │ bar │ baz  │ //│ frobnicate │ bar │ quuz │ //└────────────┴─────┴──────┘ ```  By setting all chars to empty with the exception of 'middle' being set to a single space and by setting padding to zero, it's possible to get the most compact layout with no decorations: ```javascript var table = new Table({   chars: { 'top': '' , 'top-mid': '' , 'top-left': '' , 'top-right': ''          , 'bottom': '' , 'bottom-mid': '' , 'bottom-left': '' , 'bottom-right': ''          , 'left': '' , 'left-mid': '' , 'mid': '' , 'mid-mid': ''          , 'right': '' , 'right-mid': '' , 'middle': ' ' },   style: { 'padding-left': 0, 'padding-right': 0 } });  table.push(     ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']   , ['frobnicate', 'bar', 'quuz'] );  console.log(table.toString()); // Outputs: //foo        bar baz //frobnicate bar quuz ```  ## Running tests  Clone the repository with all its submodules and run:  ```bash $ make test ```  ## Credits  - Guillermo Rauch &lt;guillermo@learnboost.com&gt; ([Guille](http://github.com/guille))  ## License   (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2010 LearnBoost &lt;dev@learnboost.com&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"colors@1.0.3","","","# colors.js  ## get color and style in your node.js console  <img src='https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/raw/master/screenshots/colors.png'/>  ## Installation      npm install colors  ## colors and styles!  ### text colors    - black   - red   - green   - yellow   - blue   - magenta   - cyan   - white   - gray   - grey  ### background colors      - bgBlack   - bgRed   - bgGreen   - bgYellow   - bgBlue   - bgMagenta   - bgCyan   - bgWhite  ### styles    - reset   - bold   - dim   - italic   - underline   - inverse   - hidden   - strikethrough  ### extras    - rainbow   - zebra   - america   - trap   - random   ## Usage  By popular demand, `colors` now ships with two types of usages!  The super nifty way  ```js var colors = require('colors');  console.log('hello'.green); // outputs green text console.log('i like cake and pies'.underline.red) // outputs red underlined text console.log('inverse the color'.inverse); // inverses the color console.log('OMG Rainbows!'.rainbow); // rainbow console.log('Run the trap'.trap); // Drops the bass  ```  or a slightly less nifty way which doesn't extend `String.prototype`  ```js var colors = require('colors/safe');  console.log(colors.green('hello')); // outputs green text console.log(colors.red.underline('i like cake and pies')) // outputs red underlined text console.log(colors.inverse('inverse the color')); // inverses the color console.log(colors.rainbow('OMG Rainbows!')); // rainbow console.log(colors.trap('Run the trap')); // Drops the bass  ```  I prefer the first way. Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way.   If you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.  ## Disabling Colors  To disable colors you can pass the following arguments in the command line to your application:  ```bash node myapp.js --no-color ```  ## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)  ```js var name = 'Marak'; console.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name); // outputs -> 'Hello Marak' ```  ## Custom themes  ### Using standard API  ```js  var colors = require('colors');  colors.setTheme({   silly: 'rainbow',   input: 'grey',   verbose: 'cyan',   prompt: 'grey',   info: 'green',   data: 'grey',   help: 'cyan',   warn: 'yellow',   debug: 'blue',   error: 'red' });  // outputs red text console.log('this is an error'.error);  // outputs yellow text console.log('this is a warning'.warn); ```  ### Using string safe API  ```js var colors = require('colors/safe');  // set single property var error = colors.red; error('this is red');  // set theme colors.setTheme({   silly: 'rainbow',   input: 'grey',   verbose: 'cyan',   prompt: 'grey',   info: 'green',   data: 'grey',   help: 'cyan',   warn: 'yellow',   debug: 'blue',   error: 'red' });  // outputs red text console.log(colors.error('this is an error'));  // outputs yellow text console.log(colors.warn('this is a warning')); ```  *Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`. If you find the style you can summon him.*","MIT","colors","1.0.3"

The `.stack` and `.message` properties will be carried over from the original error and `.code` or any passed properties will be set on it.   ## Tests  `$ npm test`   ## License  Released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).","MIT","err-code","2.0.3"

"esprima@1.0.4","Copyright (C) 2012, 2011 [Ariya Hidayat](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/about).  and other contributors.","","**Esprima** ([esprima.org](http://esprima.org)) is a high performance, standard-compliant [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) parser written in ECMAScript (also popularly known as [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>JavaScript)). Esprima is created and maintained by [Ariya Hidayat](http://twitter.com/ariyahidayat), with the help of [many contributors](https://github.com/ariya/esprima/contributors).  Esprima runs on web browsers (IE 6+, Firefox 1+, Safari 3+, Chrome 1+, Konqueror 4.6+, Opera 8+) as well as [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).  ### Features  - Full support for [ECMAScript 5.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)(ECMA-262) - Sensible [syntax tree format](http://esprima.org/doc/index.html#ast) compatible with Mozilla [Parser AST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey/Parser_API) - Heavily tested (> 550 [unit tests](http://esprima.org/test/) with solid 100% statement coverage) - Optional tracking of syntax node location (index-based and line-column) - Experimental support for ES6/Harmony (module, class, destructuring, ...)  Esprima is blazing fast (see the [benchmark suite](http://esprima.org/test/benchmarks.html)). It is up to 3x faster than UglifyJS v1 and it is still [competitive](http://esprima.org/test/compare.html) with the new generation of fast parsers.  ### Applications  Esprima serves as the basis for many popular JavaScript development tools:  - Code coverage analysis: [node-cover](https://github.com/itay/node-cover), [Istanbul](https://github.com/yahoo/Istanbul) - Documentation tool: [JFDoc](https://github.com/thejohnfreeman/jfdoc), [JSDuck](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck) - Language extension: [LLJS](http://mbebenita.github.com/LLJS/) (low-level JS), [Sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org/) (macro) - ES6/Harmony transpiler: [Six](https://github.com/matthewrobb/six), [Harmonizr](https://github.com/jdiamond/harmonizr) - Eclipse Orion smart editing ([outline view](https://github.com/aclement/esprima-outline), [content assist](http://contraptionsforprogramming.blogspot.com/2012/02/better-javascript-content-assist-in.html)) - Source code modification: [Esmorph](https://github.com/ariya/esmorph), [Code Painter](https://github.com/fawek/codepainter), - Source transformation: [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), [Esmangle](https://github.com/Constellation/esmangle), [escodegen](https://github.com/Constellation/escodegen)  ### Questions? - [Documentation](http://esprima.org/doc) - [Issue tracker](http://issues.esprima.org): [known problems](http://code.google.com/p/esprima/issues/list?q=Defect) and [future plans](http://code.google.com/p/esprima/issues/list?q=Enhancement) - [Mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/esprima) - [Contribution guide](http://esprima.org/doc/index.html#contribution)  Follow [@Esprima](http://twitter.com/Esprima) on Twitter to get the development updates. Feedback and contribution are welcomed!  ### License  Copyright (C) 2012, 2011 [Ariya Hidayat](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/about)  and other contributors.

"fp-and-or@0.1.3","","","# fp-and-or [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fp-and-or.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/fp-and-or)  Simple `and` and `or` functional programming predicates.  - `and(...fs): (...args): boolean` - Returns a predicate that returns true if **all** arguments are true or evaluate to true for the given input. - `or(...fs): (...args): boolean` - Returns a predicate that returns true if **at least one** argument is true or evaluates to true for the given input.  A predicate is a function that returns a `boolean`, commonly used in `Array.prototype.filter`.  e.g.  ```js const isEven = n => n%2 === 0 const isPositive = n => n > 0  // un-fancy items.filter(x => isEven(x) || isPositive(x))  // fancy items.filter(or(isEven, isPositive)) ```  ## Install  ```sh npm install --save fp-and-or ```  ## Usage  ```js const { and, or } = require('fp-and-or')  const isEven = n => n % 2 === 0 const isPositive = n => n > 0 const isBig = n => Math.abs(n) >= 1000 ```  ### and  #### return true with no predicates ```js and()(1) // true ```  #### return result of single predicate ```js and(isEven)(1) // false and(isEven)(2) // true ```  #### return logical AND of two predicates ```js and(isEven, isPositive)(-2) // false and(isEven, isPositive)(-1) // false and(isEven, isPositive)(1) // false and(isEven, isPositive)(2) // true ```  #### return logical AND of three predicates ```js and(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(-2) // false and(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(-1) // false and(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(1) // false and(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(2) // false and(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(-1002) // false and(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(-1001) // false and(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(1001) // false and(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(1002) // true ```  #### return value of single boolean ```js and(true)(1) // true and(false)(1) // false ```  #### return value of two booleans ```js and(false, false)(1) // false and(false, true)(1) // false and(true, false)(1) // false and(true, true)(1) // true ```  #### return value of multiple booleans ```js and(false, false, false)(1) // false and(false, true, false)(1) // false and(true, false, false)(1) // false and(true, true, false)(1) // false and(false, false, true)(1) // false and(false, true, true)(1) // false and(true, false, true)(1) // false and(true, true, true)(1) // true ```  #### return value of mixed booleans and functions ```js and(false, isEven)(1) // false and(false, isEven)(2) // false and(true, isEven)(1) // false and(true, isEven)(2) // true and(isEven, false)(1) // false and(isEven, false)(2) // false and(isEven, true)(1) // false and(isEven, true)(2) // true ```  ### or  #### return false with no predicates ```js or()(1) // false ```  #### return result of single predicate ```js or(isEven)(1) // false or(isEven)(2) // true ```  #### return logical OR of two predicates ```js or(isEven, isPositive)(-2) // true or(isEven, isPositive)(-1) // false or(isEven, isPositive)(1) // true or(isEven, isPositive)(2) // true ```  #### return logical OR of three predicates ```js or(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(-2) // true or(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(-1) // false or(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(0) // true or(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(1) // true or(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(2) // true or(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(-1002) // true or(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(-1001) // true or(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(1001) // true or(isEven, isPositive, isBig)(1002) // true ```  #### return value of single boolean ```js or(true)(1) // true or(false)(1) // false ```  #### return value of two booleans ```js or(false, false)(1) // false or(false, true)(1) // true or(true, false)(1) // true or(true, true)(1) // true ```  #### return value of multiple booleans ```js or(false, false, false)(1) // false or(false, true, false)(1) // true or(true, false, false)(1) // true or(true, true, false)(1) // true or(false, false, true)(1) // true or(false, true, true)(1) // true or(true, false, true)(1) // true or(true, true, true)(1) // true ```  #### return value of mixed booleans and functions ```js or(false, isEven)(1) // false or(false, isEven)(2) // true or(true, isEven)(1) // true or(true, isEven)(2) // true or(isEven, false)(1) // false or(isEven, false)(2) // true or(isEven, true)(1) // true or(isEven, true)(2) // true ```","ISC","fp-and-or","0.1.3"

"https-proxy-agent@5.0.0","Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;","","https-proxy-agent ================ ### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.  Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary 'proxy' server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.  Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets). See the 'Examples' section below for more.   Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install https-proxy-agent ```   Examples --------  #### `https` module example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var https = require('https'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var options = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy); options.agent = agent;  https.get(options, function (res) {   console.log(''response' event!', res.headers);   res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `ws` WebSocket connection example  ``` js var url = require('url'); var WebSocket = require('ws'); var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');  // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org'; var parsed = url.parse(endpoint); console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);  // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var options = url.parse(proxy);  var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);  // finally, initiate the WebSocket connection var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });  socket.on('open', function () {   console.log(''open' event!');   socket.send('hello world'); });  socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {   console.log(''message' event! %j %j', data, flags);   socket.close(); }); ```  API ---  ### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)  The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects to the specified 'HTTP(s) proxy server' in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].  The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an 'options' object with more specific properties:    * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.   * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.   * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.   * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.   * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

"imurmurhash@0.1.4","","","iMurmurHash.js ==============  An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).  This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.  Installation ------------  To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.  ```html <script type='text/javascript' src='/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js'></script> <script> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3 </script> ```  ---  To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:  ```bash npm install imurmurhash ```  Then simply include it in your scripts:  ```javascript MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash'); ```  Quick Example -------------  ```javascript // Create the initial hash var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');  // Incrementally add text hashState.hash('more strings'); hashState.hash('even more strings');  // All calls can be chained if desired hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');  // Get a result hashState.result(); // returns 0xe4ccfe6b ```  Functions ---------  ### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed]) Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:  ```javascript // Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same // object (but reset, so the current state would be lost) hashState = MurmurHash3(); ...  // Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the // function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss // will occur, at the cost of creating more objects. hashState = new MurmurHash3(); ```  Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string) Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.result () Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.  ```javascript // Do the whole string at once MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result(); // 0x70529328  // Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part var m = MurmurHash3('this is a'); m.result(); // 0xbfc4f834 m.hash(' test string').result(); // 0x70529328 (same as above) ```  ---  ### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed]) Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.  ---  License (MIT) ------------- Copyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

"jsonlines@0.1.1","","","# JSONLines for Node.js  Parse [JSONLines](http://jsonlines.org) with Node.js.  ## Installation  ```sh npm install --save jsonlines ```  ## Usage  ```javascript var jsonlines = require('jsonlines') var parser = jsonlines.parse()  parser.on('data', function (data) {   console.log('Got json:', data) })  parser.on('end', function () {   console.log('No more data') })  parser.write('{ 'test': 'This is a test!' }\n') parser.write('{ 'jsonlines': 'is awesome' }') parser.end() ```  ```javascript var jsonlines = require('jsonlines') var stringifier = jsonlines.stringify()  stringifier.pipe(process.stdout)  stringifier.write({ test: 'This is a test!' }) stringifier.write({ jsonlines: 'is awesome' }) stringifier.end() ```  ## API  ### `.parse([options])`  Returns a transform stream that turns newline separated json into a stream of javascript values.  `options` is an optional object with the keys documented below.  ### `.stringify()`  Returns a transform stream that turns javascript values into a stream of newline separated json.  ## Options  ### `emitInvalidLine`  If true, instead of emitting an error and cancelling the stream when an invalid line is proccessed, an `invalid-line` event is emitted with the same error. This is very useful when processing text that have mixed plain text and json data.  Example:  ```js var jsonlines = require('jsonlines') var parser = jsonlines.parse({ emitInvalidLines: true })  parser.on('data', function (data) {   console.log('Got json:', data) })  parser.on('invalid-line', function (err) {   console.log('Got text:', err.source) })  parser.write('{ 'test': 'This is a test!' }\n') parser.write('This is some plain text\n') parser.write('{ 'jsonlines': 'is awesome' }') parser.end() ```  Output:  ```text Got json: { test: 'This is a test!' } Got text: This is some plain text Got json: { jsonlines: 'is awesome' } ```","MIT","jsonlines","0.1.1"

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.  ### Section 1 – Definitions.  a. **Adapted Material** means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.  b. **Adapter's License** means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.  c. **BY-SA Compatible License** means a license listed at [creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses](http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses), approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.  d. **Copyright and Similar Rights** means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.  e. **Effective Technological Measures** means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.  f. **Exceptions and Limitations** means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.  g. **License Elements** means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.  h. **Licensed Material** means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.  i. **Licensed Rights** means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.  j. **Licensor** means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.  k. **Share** means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.  l. **Sui Generis Database Rights** means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.  m. **You** means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.  ### Section 2 – Scope.  a. **_License grant.**_      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:          A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and          B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.      2. **Exceptions and Limitations.** For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.      3. **Term.** The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).      4. **Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.** The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.      5. **Downstream recipients.**          A. **Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.** Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.          B. **Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.          C. **No downstream restrictions.** You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.      6. **No endorsement.** Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).  b. **_Other rights.**_      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.  ### Section 3 – License Conditions.  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.  a. **_Attribution.**_      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:          A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:              i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);              ii. a copyright notice;              iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;              iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;              v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;          B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and          C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.  b. **_ShareAlike.**_  In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.  1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.  2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.  3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.  ### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.  ### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.  a. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.**  c.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.  d.

"socks-proxy-agent@5.0.1","Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;","","socks-proxy-agent ================ ### A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS [![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)  This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified SOCKS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `http` and `https` modules.  It can also be used in conjunction with the `ws` module to establish a WebSocket connection over a SOCKS proxy. See the 'Examples' section below.  Installation ------------  Install with `npm`:  ``` bash $ npm install socks-proxy-agent ```   Examples --------  #### TypeScript example  ```ts import https from 'https'; import { SocksProxyAgent } from 'socks-proxy-agent';  const info = { 	host: 'br41.nordvpn.com', 	userId: 'your-name@gmail.com', 	password: 'abcdef12345124' }; const agent = new SocksProxyAgent(info);  https.get('https://jsonip.org', { agent }, (res) => { 	console.log(res.headers); 	res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `http` module example  ```js var url = require('url'); var http = require('http'); var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');  // SOCKS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var opts = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy); opts.agent = agent;  http.get(opts, function (res) { 	console.log(''response' event!', res.headers); 	res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `https` module example  ```js var url = require('url'); var https = require('https'); var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');  // SOCKS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/'; console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint); var opts = url.parse(endpoint);  // create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy); opts.agent = agent;  https.get(opts, function (res) { 	console.log(''response' event!', res.headers); 	res.pipe(process.stdout); }); ```  #### `ws` WebSocket connection example  ``` js var WebSocket = require('ws'); var SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');  // SOCKS proxy to connect to var proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:1080'; console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);  // WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org'; console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);  // create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information var agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);  // initiate the WebSocket connection var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });  socket.on('open', function () { 	console.log(''open' event!'); 	socket.send('hello world'); });  socket.on('message', function (data, flags) { 	console.log(''message' event! %j %j', data, flags); 	socket.close(); }); ```  License -------  (The MIT License)  Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
