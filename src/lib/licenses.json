Please visit the main [Fontsource website](https://fontsource.org/fonts/fira-mono) to view more details on this package.\n\n## Quick Installation\n\nFontsource has a variety of methods to import CSS, such as using a bundler like Webpack. Alternatively, it supports SASS. Full documentation can be found [here](https://fontsource.org/docs/introduction).\n\n```javascript\nyarn add @fontsource/fira-mono // npm install @fontsource/fira-mono\n```\n\nWithin your app entry file or site component, import it in.\n\n```javascript\nimport \"@fontsource/fira-mono\"; // Defaults to weight 400.\n```\n\nSupported variables:\n\n- Weights: `[400,500,700]`\n- Styles: `[normal]`\n- Supported subsets: `[cyrillic,cyrillic-ext,greek,greek-ext,latin,latin-ext]`\n\nFinally, you can reference the font name in a CSS stylesheet, CSS Module, or CSS-in-JS.\n\n```css\nbody {\n  font-family: \"Fira Mono\";\n}\n```\n\n## Licensing\n\nIt is important to always read the license for every font that you use.\nMost of the fonts in the collection use the SIL Open Font License, v1.1. Some fonts use the Apache 2 license. The Ubuntu fonts use the Ubuntu Font License v1.0.\n\n[Google Fonts License Attributions](https://fonts.google.com/attribution)\n\n## Other Notes\n\nFont version (provided by source): `v14`.\n\nFeel free to star and contribute new ideas to this repository that aim to improve the performance of font loading, as well as expanding the existing library we already have. Any suggestions or ideas can be voiced via an [issue](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues).",
